# Notes

- Apache Kafka and Zookeeper are supposed to be deployed in the cloud node.
- In the YAML files, replace the IP/nodename with the one of your cloud node.
- This deployment is a single-pod zookeeper and broker combo.
- Deploying Apache Kafka on the edge node has been tested without success.
