# Sedna-examples
A directory to share Sedna examples and tutorials to demonstrate how Sedna can implement cross edge-cloud collaborative training 
and collaborative inference capabilities.  

This repository is home to the following features of examples:
* [Joint Inference](#joint-inference)
* [Incremental Learning](#incremental-learning)
* [Federated Learning](#federated-learning)
* [Lifelong Learning](#lifelong-learning)
* [Pedestrians ReID](#pedestrian-reid)
* [Shared Storage](#shared-storage)
