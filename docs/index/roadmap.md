# Roadmap

This document defines a high level roadmap for sedna development.

The [milestones defined in GitHub](https://github.com/kubeedge/sedna/milestones) represent the most up-to-date plans.

## 2022 Roadmap

- Integrate some common multi-task migration algorithms to resolve the problem of low precision caused by small size
  samples.
- Integrate KubeFlow and ONNX into Sedna, to enable interoperability of edge models with diverse formats.
- Integrate typical AI frameworks into Sedna, include Tensorflow, Pytorch, PaddlePaddle and Mindspore etc.
- Support edge model and dataset management.
