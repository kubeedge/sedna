This guide covers how to start contributing to Sedna ðŸ˜„

## 1. Familiarize Yourself With Contributing to Sedna

### Setup GitHub Account

Sedna is developed on [GitHub][github] and will require
an account for contribution.

### Check The Kubernetes Contributor Guides

You may come back to this later, but we highly recommend reading these:

- [Kubernetes Contributor Guide](https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/guide) 
  - Main contributor documentation, or you can just jump directly to the [contributing section](https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/guide#contributing)
- [Contributor Cheat Sheet](https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/guide/contributor-cheatsheet)
   - Common resources for existing developers


### Read The Sedna Docs 

These [proposals] cover framework and multi edge-cloud synergy capabilities of the project, which may be helpful to review before contributing. 

### Reaching Out

Issues are tracked on GitHub. Please check [the issue tracker][issues] to see
if there is any existing discussion or work related to your interests.

In particular, if you're just getting started, you may want to look for issues
labeled <a href="https://github.com/kubeedge/sedna/labels/good%20first%20issue" class="gh-label" style="background: #7057ff; color: white">good first issue</a> or <a href="https://github.com/kubeedge/sedna/labels/help%20wanted" class="gh-label" style="background: #006b75; color: white">help wanted</a> which are standard labels in the Kubernetes project.
The <a href="https://github.com/kubeedge/sedna/labels/help%20wanted" class="gh-label" style="background: #006b75; color: white">help wanted</a> label marks issues we're actively seeking help with while <a href="https://github.com/kubeedge/sedna/labels/good%20first%20issue" class="gh-label" style="background: #7057ff; color: white">good first issue</a> is additionally applied to a subset of issues we think will be particularly good for newcomers.

See [Kubernetes help wanted] for best practices.

If you're interested in working on any of these, leave a comment to let us know!

And please reach out in general for bugs, feature requests, and other issues!
If you do not see anything, please [file a new issue][file-an-issue].

> **NOTE**: _Please_ file an enhancement / [feature request issue][file-a-fr] to discuss features before filing a PR (ideally even before writing any code), we have a lot to consider with respect to our
> existing users and future support when accepting any new feature.
>
> To streamline the process, please reach out and discuss the concept and design
> / approach ASAP so the maintainers and community can get involved early.


## 2. What's Next?

- If you're looking to contribute documentation improvements, you'll specifically want to see the [kubernetes documentation style guide] before [filing an issue][file-an-issue].

- If you're planning to contribute code changes, you'll want to read the [development preparation guide] next.

- If you're planning to add a new synergy feature directly, you'll want to read the [guide][add-feature-guide] next.

When done, you can also refer our [recommended Git workflow] and [pull request best practices] before submitting a pull request.
