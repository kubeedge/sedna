# Lifelong Learning

At present, edge-cloud synergy machine learning is confronted with the challenge of heterogeneous data distributions in complex scenarios and small samples on the edge. The edge-cloud synergy lifelong learning is accordingly proposed: 1) In order to learn with shared knowledge between historical scenarios, the scheme is essentially the combination of another two learning schemes, i.e., multi-task learning and incremental learning; 2) The cloud knowledge base in lifelong learning empowers the scheme with memory ability, which helps to adapt historical knowledge to new and unseen situations on the edge. Joining the forces of multi-task learning, incremental learning and the knowledge base, the lifelong learning scheme seeks to fundamentally overcome the above challenges of edge-cloud synergy machine learning.

For showing detailed design of Sedna lifelong learning in iterative versions, we list them as belows.

- [Structured lifelong learning](./structured-lifelong-learning.md): it realizes edge-cloud collaborative continuous learning, knowledge sharing across the edge of the cloud, and automatic discovery and transfer learning of new knowledge.
- [Unstructured lifelong learning](./unstructured-lifelong-learning.md): compared to structured lifelong learning, this version accomplishes unseen task detection, online unseen task processing and offline unseen task training, in order to taskle data heterogeneity and data deficiency at the edge.
