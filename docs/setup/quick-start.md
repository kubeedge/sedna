There are some ways to set up Sedna, depends on your use case:
- If you have none Kubernetes environment and don't want to install Kubernetes manually, you can follow [the instruction](./all-in-one.md) to install all-in-one Sedna environment.

- Otherwise, when Kubernetes is ready, you can follow [this instruction](./install.md) to install Sedna on the existing Kubernetes cluster.

- One more thing: we also have a local-up install script available for easier Sedna development. The local-up version boots a local Kubernetes cluster and installs Sedna based on a local repository. The use case and setup procedures are available [here](./local-up.md).


After set up Sedna, you can try out [examples](/examples).
